## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep teal (#008080) that reflects competence and creativity, without being a cliche Android primary color.  It communicates technological expertise but doesn't appear too corporate.
- Background color: Very light desaturated teal (#F0FFFF) to create a calm and professional backdrop that complements the primary color.
- Accent color: A warm yellow-gold (#D4AF37), analogous to green and blue, for highlights and call-to-action buttons, conveying prestige.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, provides a contemporary, fashionable, avant-garde look, excellent for a professional portfolio.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif, to give a modern, neutral appearance. Provides the reader with a familiar look, not tiring their eyes easily.
- Use a set of crisp, modern icons for sections and skills, ensuring they are easily recognizable and align with the overall aesthetic. Prefer Android system icons if possible.
- Employ a clean and responsive layout, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring readability and ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting, like smooth scrolling or fade-in effects.
